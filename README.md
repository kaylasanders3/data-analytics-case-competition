# Grocery Store Data Analysis – Case Competition Project

## Project Overview
This project involved analyzing the **CompleteJourney_py** dataset from a grocery store case competition. The goal was to extract actionable insights from the data to inform business decisions, focusing on customer behavior, product performance, and sales trends. Our analysis was summarized in a **PowerPoint presentation** that we delivered virtually to the competition panel.  

## Data Used
- **Dataset:** CompleteJourney_py  
- **Type:** Grocery store transaction, customer, and promotion data   
- **Source:** Provided as part of the case competition  

## Technical Skills & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn (for visualization)  
- **Data Techniques:** Cleaning, aggregation, exploratory data analysis, visualization  
- **Presentation:** Microsoft PowerPoint  

## Methods
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:**  
   - Handled missing values and inconsistent entries  
   - Standardized categorical data  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis:**  
   - Generated descriptive statistics
   - Examined relationships between different features and identified patterns across the 8 DataFrames  
3. **Insight Extraction:**  
   - Analyzed purchasing patterns, product performance, and customer behavior  
   - Identified actionable recommendations for the grocery store  
4. **Presentation Preparation:**  
   - Summarized findings in a clear, visual PowerPoint  
   - Presented analysis and recommendations to the competition panel
